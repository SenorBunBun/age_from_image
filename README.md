# CNN Regression Model For Predicting Age from Images

A personal project for experimenting with CNN Regression to predict ages (20-50) from an given image. Resulted in a MAE of 7.5 and R2 Score of 0.03. Additionally, I experimented with CNN Class Activation Mapping visualization. This was made with TensorFlow and Keras.
