# CNN Regression Model For Predicting Age from Images

A personal project for experimenting with CNN Regression to predict ages (20-50) from an given image. Resulted in a MAE of 7.5 and R2 Score of 0.30. Additionally, I also visualized the CNN's Class Activation Mapping on a specific test image. This was made with TensorFlow and Keras.

The relevant approach, implementation, and visualization is located within the age_prediction.ipynb .
